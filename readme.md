# How To CityScience Minecraft

Note: If you have already purchaced the software through your iPad, Android, iPhone, or other gaming consoles (Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch) you are in the wrong version and it will not work.

## 1. Create and account and buy
The city science server uses the java version of mincraft. First you will need to create and buy an account for this. 

1. create an account at https://my.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft/#register

2. buy minecraft (apperently it is not free…)

3. download the launcher

At this point you can play mincraft locally with the *vanilla* version. To connect to the city science server and meet your friends, you need few more steps.

## 2. Install Forge
This is a different version of minecraft that let’s you modify the game (use `mods`). We’re not sure if we will be overly excited to actually create `mods` but we’re using it just in case.

1. Download Forge MC 1.15.2 (http://files.minecraftforge.net/)

2. Install it by double clicking the forge-X.Y.Z-A.B.C-installer.jar file.
  * you may need to install the [latest Java Run Time](https://java.com/en/download/)
  * you're might complain that it's from an unauthorized vendor. Click open.
  
Now you are ready to get in.

## 3. Join server
So everything out of the way, we are now ready to connect!

1. launch minecraft, check if you see forge next to the play button. and hit play.

2. we want multiplayer, so click multiplayer

3. add server with the ip address and port (ask yasushi for this info)

4. connect

enjoy!
